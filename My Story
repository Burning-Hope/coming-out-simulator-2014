Hello...
Do you know who I am?
...
I think you think you do.
I think you see me as your daughter.
IS this right?
That was correct, 
if you didn't know me...
I am transgendered.
I am a boy.
I was born this way.
But why didn't I say anything?
...
Why didn't I say anything about my PTSD?
Why didn't I say anything about liking boys,
and girls,
and other trans people?
Why didn't I say...
Why don't I say it to you...
Why?
...
...
I've asked my self WHY a lot of times.
Mainly why don't- can't
Why is love something I no longer feel for my parents...
Why is it that I've felt this way for years.
Y E A R S 
...
That lies have been at the back of my throat.
...
Why?
...
Because I don't feel safe.
Because I cry so much.
Because I will never love them again.
Because of all the things they have done to me,
And didn't do for me,
And what they ignored,
And what they lied about,
And what?

Can't you see thing is me?

I've been here the whole time.

Can't you see?
